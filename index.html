							<h2>About Me:</h2>
							<p>I have always been passionate about video games and computers in general, my first console was the Nintendo 64. My passion has been what brought me to America first to learn c++ in California, and after that to Tokyo to learn 3D design. I also discovered an interest for programming in general, at first it was simply a mean to make games but I appreciate coding on its own now, especially python.</p>

									<h3>Programming Languages.</h3>
									<p>I obtained a <a href="images/DiplômeDVCEdouard.pdf" target="_blank">certificate</a> of advanced C++ Programming from Diablo Valley College in Californa and since then learned Python to make tools for 3Dartists, while using GIT for version control. </p>

									<h3>I worked with other students at HAL to make Games.</h3>
									<p>We completed a 2D game on unity and for our final year's project made another one in UE5, the group i worked with consisted of other Designers, Programmers and Planners. As the only Technical Artist in the team I learned to communicate with each part of the project be it the artistic or technical side and helped resolves issues as they arise during game development by developping tools.</p>
